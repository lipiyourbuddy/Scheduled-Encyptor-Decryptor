1. Digital Certificate Request Portal

Objective: To develop a secure, full-stack Java-based web application that allows users to request, track, and download digital signature certificates (DSCs), while enabling administrators to process and manage those requests efficiently. The portal is intended to simulate a real-world certificate authority (CA) system, aligning with eMudhra's domain in PKI and digital identity.

Scope:

User registration and authentication

Role-based access (User/Admin)

Request form for digital signature certificates

File upload for Certificate Signing Request (CSR) or KYC documents

Admin dashboard for approving/rejecting requests

Status tracking and notifications

Downloadable signed certificates (simulated)


Technology Stack:

Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC

Frontend: Thymeleaf / JSP (optional: React for SPA)

Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL

Security: Spring Security, BCrypt

Other Tools: JavaMail API (email alerts), Apache POI or iText (PDF generation), JCE (encryption)


Functional Modules:

User Module:

User registration with OTP/email verification

Login and profile management

2. Eclipse Spring MVC Project
This beginner-friendly Eclipse Spring MVC project involves setting up a full Java web application using Spring MVC within the Eclipse IDE. Students can build a basic user management system that allows registration, login, profile updates, and session handling. The goal is to understand the project setup lifecycle, request-response flow, and MVC pattern implementation using Eclipse as the development environment.

Tech Stack: Spring MVC (annotation-based controllers), Eclipse IDE, JSP for views, Hibernate or JDBC for ORM, and MySQL for database operations.
Skills Developed: Project configuration in Eclipse, servlet dispatcher setup, creating controller classes, view resolvers, and connecting model objects to the database. It enhances your understanding of MVC flow, routing, form binding, and data persistence.
Academic Value: Serves as a foundational basic MVC project for students to get hands-on experience in configuring, coding, and deploying a Spring MVC application using Eclipse—especially useful for those new to Java web development and looking for practical MVC project ideas for beginners.
